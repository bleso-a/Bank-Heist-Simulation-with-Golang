# Bank-Heist-Simulation-with-Golang
Use conditionals to account for different situations and outcomes in Bank Heist (uncertainty). 
In this project, I used conditionals to simulate this situation along with different hiccups that may pop up in a Bank Heist.
At the end, either get away with money or get caught!
